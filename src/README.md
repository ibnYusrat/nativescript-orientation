# Free version for `nativeScript-orientation` (renamed to `nativeScript-orientation-free`)

A rather maintained version of `nativeScript-orientation`. This is simply a fork of `nativeScript-orientation` which is no longer available without a subscription 
and is not guaranteed to work with NativeScript 6.x. This repo is my attempt towards keeping it usable enough for those who are not ready to buy a subscription yet.

To use this, simply install with NPM using:

`npm install nativeScript-orientation-free`
